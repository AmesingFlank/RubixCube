# RubixCube

A 3D Rubik's Cube App on Android implemented by OpenGL ES 2.0

A shameful comment: 
This is a project that I made in my very early days as a rookie programmer, therefore it does NOT serve as good reference of my current coding style and abilities !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! T_T



Features:
* It's in 3D...
* Display a solution of the Cube using Fridrich (CFOP) algorithm
* The scan function : use the phone's camera to scan a real-world Rubik's Cube into the app.

Known Bugs:
Possible outofmemory error when using the scanning function due to unoptimized handling of Bitmaps.
