# RubixCube

A 3D Rubik's Cube App on Android implemented by OpenGL ES 2.0

Features:
* It's in 3D...
* Display a solution of the Cube using Fridrich (CFOP) algorithm
* The scan function : use the phone's camera to scan a real-world Rubik's Cube into the app.

Known Bugs:
Possible outofmemory error when using the scanning function due to unoptimized (is that a word?) handling of Bitmaps.
Will fix soon.
